The shoots are conspicuously dimorphic (2). The brown, non-assimilating fertile stems have only 4 to 6 relatively distant sheaths (3). The main stems of the assimilating shoots are both erect and decumbent (4), and they are bright green in color (5). The main stems are slightly rough (6) and bear whorls of slender branches at the nodes (7). These stems die down in autumn (8). The longitudinal internodal grooves in the main stem internodes of the assimilating shoots are deep, with prominent ridges between (10). The main stem internodes have a central hollow (11). The central hollow of the main stem internodes of assimilating shoots is much less than half the diameter of the internode and about half the diameter of the internode (12). The endodermis in the main stem internodes of assimilating shoots comprises a single layer outside the ring of vascular bundles (13). The main stem sheaths of assimilating shoots are about as broad as long (14). The teeth of the main stem sheaths of assimilating shoots are ribbed (16). The primary branching is symmetrical (18), and the primary branches are numerous (19). The primary branches are both spreading and drooping (20). The primary branches of assimilating shoots are simple (21). The first primary branch internodes of assimilating shoots are at least as long as the subtending sheaths, at least on the upper parts of the stem (22). The primary branch internodes are solid (23). The stomata of assimilating shoots are not sunken (24). The cones are blunt (25). The spores are fertile (26) and are released in April (27).
